# Technical Test #

## Welcome to the Equiniti Toplevel Tech Test ##
This technical test is for candidates wishing to apply for Software Engineering roles with Equiniti Toplevel. Our available roles are advertised here: [http://equiniticareers.com/opportunities/](http://equiniticareers.com/opportunities/) 

If you have stumbled upon this repository before applying for a role, please contact us through our careers site first.

Otherwise, please read through the next sections, there are no tricks here. We want you to have some fun showing us what you can do and how you do it.

## What do we want you to do? ##
We want you to create a REST API for a simple data set that we will provide.  

The REST API should allow for create, read, update and delete actions on resources.

The API will be publicly accessible so consider the security implications of this.

The sample data can be found here: [sample-data.json](https://github.com/philwebb-equiniti/equiniti-toplevel/blob/master/sample-data.json "sample-data.json")

## How do we want you to do it? ##
We expect the submission you provide to contain the following:

- a complete solution runnable on Windows;
- structured, readable, maintainable code;
- comments;

The data can just be persisted to a file on the file system, we don't expect a database.

You should follow industry best practices and consider: separation of concerns, testability, security, scalability and performance.

You should choose an appropriate framework and technology for your solution considering the role you are applying for - usually C#.

Your solution may contain dependencies to publicly available packages (from nuget.org for example).

We don't expect you to take more than 2 or 3 hours creating your solution, but it is up to you how long you spend.  

## How do you submit your test? ##
You can submit your solution via an exported, public accessible or privately shared repository (e.g. GitHub or BitBucket). We would like to see your commit history as well as the final submission.

You will have been supplied with an email address for posting a link to your submission from an Equiniti Toplevel hiring manager.
